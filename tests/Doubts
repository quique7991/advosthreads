New doubts:
* When a thread cancels other thread in the man of pthreads_cancel, it says that the threat  3. The thread is terminated.  (See pthread_exit(3).) What this means?
* When a thread is cancel the documentations says that "After a canceled thread has terminated, a join with that thread using pthread_join(3)  obtains
PTHREAD_CANCELED  as the thread's exit status.  (Joining with a thread is the only way to know
that cancellation has completed.)" What value do we use a pthread_canceled?


Doubts
1. what size of stack should I use?
64 kb (signals use 8kB) would be ok, (include signal.h check the piazza file)
2. What happens when we move from one thread to another that doesn't have any work to do?
It is not required...
3. Does the switching time is counted in the quantum? Or only when it starts executing?
One time shoot timer
4. When a program yields, does we restart the timer?
Yes

Main is also a thread in the linked list.



Notes to my self
1. Remember to free the stack.

http://www.evanjones.ca/software/threading.html (Implementing Fibers Using makecontext)

Essentially, 
* getcontext saves the current execution context
* setcontext switches to the specified execution context
* swapcontext will save the current context and switch to another
* makecontext creates a new execution context. 

To create a new thread, 
1. we call getcontext to retrieve the current context then modify the members of the ucontext_t struct to specify the new context. A
2. We must allocate a new stack, but this time the library takes care of the direction of the stack growth. 
3. Then we call makecontext and specify the function and arguments to execute in the thread

How to achieve a context switch?
* The thread must explicitly yield control to allow other thread to run. 
* The swapcontext function can be used to stop executing one thread and continue executing another..

*Use the uc_link for the return!!!
