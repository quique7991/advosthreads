/*
Many of these pthread functions either return an error code or return non-zero and set errno 
to an error code when they have an error. These error codes tell the caller what, specifically, went wrong. 
However, you do not need to return proper error codes in your gtthread library; simply returning non-zero 
when an error occurrs is good enough, and you do not ever need to set errno. (It's also okay for a function to 
always return zero if it is written in a way that it cannot ever fail. Error returns are only needed when errors 
occur.)

Taken from the pthreads linux man

The  gtthread_create()  function  starts  a  new thread in the calling process.  The new thread
starts execution by invoking start_routine(); arg is passed as the sole argument of 
start_routine().
The new thread terminates in one of the following ways:

* It  calls  gtthread_exit(3),  specifying  an  exit  status value that is available to another
 thread in the same process that calls gtthread_join.

* It returns from start_routine().  This is equivalent to  calling  gtthread_exit  with  the
 value supplied in the return statement.

* It is canceled (see gtthread_cancel).

* Any  of  the threads in the process calls exit(3), or the main thread performs a return from
 main().  This causes the termination of all threads in the process.

 Before returning, a successful call to pthread_create() stores the ID of the new thread in the
 buffer pointed to by thread; this identifier is used to refer  to  the  thread  in  subsequent
 calls to other pthreads functions.

/*

The  gtthread_join()  function  waits for the thread specified by thread to terminate.  If that
thread has already terminated, then gtthread_join() returns immediately.  The thread  specified
by thread must be joinable.

If  status is not NULL, then gtthread_join() copies the exit status of the target thread (i.e.,
the value that the target thread supplied to pthread_exit(3)) into the location pointed to  by
*status.  If the target thread was canceled, then -1 is placed in *status.
RETURN VALUE
       On success, pthread_join() returns 0; on error, it returns an error number.

ERRORS
      -1, the function returns -1 if there is any error.

Failure  to  join  with a thread that is joinable (i.e., one that is not detached), produces a
"zombie thread".  Avoid doing this, since each zombie thread consumes some  system  resources,
and  when  enough zombie threads have accumulated, it will no longer be possible to create new
threads (or processes).

The  gtthread_exit() function terminates the calling thread and returns a value via retval that
is available to another thread in  the  same  process  that  calls pthread_join(3).

After the last thread in a process terminates, the process terminates as  by  calling  exit(3)
with  an exit status of zero.

Performing a return from the start function of any thread other than the main  thread  results
in  an implicit call to gtthread_exit(), using the function's return value as the thread's exit
status.

To allow other threads to continue execution, the main  thread  should  terminate  by  calling
gtthread_exit() rather than exit(3).

The  value pointed to by retval should not be located on the calling thread's stack, since the
contents of that stack are undefined after the thread terminates.

Deferred cancelation does not need to be implemented; all threads are canceled immediately.
The  pthread_cancel() function sends a cancellation request to the thread thread.

The  return status of gtthread_cancel() merely informs the caller whether the cancellation 
request was successfully queued.

After a canceled thread has terminated, a join with that thread using gtthread_join(3)  obtains
-1  as the thread's exit status.  (Joining with a thread is the only way to know that 
cancellation has completed.)

       On success, pthread_cancel() returns 0; on error, it returns a nonzero error number.
